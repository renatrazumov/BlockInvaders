1. Integrate the vRAM Library into your dApp Smart Contract, allowing it to interact with the vRAM system.
2. Select the service package/s that satisfy your data storage and access needs.
3. Stake the amount of DAPP Tokens needed for your chosen service package.
4. Support your favorite service provider by staking tokens to them, even if no services are required. 

### Provided by the dApp Service Providers (DSPs)

DSPs can now provide solutions for dApps' needs, including the most powerful oracle, IBC, storage, and scheduler solutions available, unlocking a wealth of functionality for dApps. As a DSP, you customize your service packages and have full autonomy over staking duration, pricing, and technical specifications.
